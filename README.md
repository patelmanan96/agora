## Agora

Agora is a centralized platform that allows users, both students and event organizers, to more
easily connect with each other. The platform provides students with a centralized location from
which to view events happening on campus and to keep track of upcoming events they have
shown interest in. The platform would also provide students with personalized recommendations
for events that they might be interested in based on their background, degree program and past
history of attended events. For event organizers, whether they be administrators, student
organizations, professors, or companies, the platform will provide them with a place to more
easily reach the Northeastern University student body. The platform will help these event
organizers keep track of the events they are hosting, since they may be hosting multiple events.
